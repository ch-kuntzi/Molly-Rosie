## 1. Brand Guidelines: The Enchanted Sanctuary

### Aesthetic: Luminous Magical Realism
*   **Art Style:** Moving away from simple watercolor to a richer, more detailed style inspired by enchanted forests and secret libraries. Lush, saturated textures with strong "glow" highlights.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Primary:** Deep Forest Green (#1b3022) and Midnight Ink (#1a2530).
    *   **Luminous:** Glow-worm Gold (#ffd700) and Bioluminescent Blue (#a3e4f8).
    *   **Accents:** Mushroom Crimson (#d64545) and Moss Sage (#8da399).
*   **Atmosphere:** Deep, quiet, and magical. Like walking through a forest made of books. High contrast between dark corners and glowing knowledge.
*   **Typography:** 
    *   **Headers:** 'Outfit' with a subtle golden outer glow.
    *   **Body:** 'Inter' on aged, cream parchment.
