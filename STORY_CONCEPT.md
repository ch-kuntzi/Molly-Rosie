# Story Concept: The Weaver of Dreams

## The Narrative Arc
Instead of a simple biography, the story is framed as Molly reflecting on the "threads" that make up the tapestry of her life. Each major event is a different colored thread that she has intentionally woven together.

## The Threads
1.  **The Vibrant Thread (Toddler Years):** Her boundless energy and "Google Eyes."
2.  **The Golden Thread (Gymnastics):** Discipline, grit, and the pursuit of perfection.
3.  **The Silver Thread (Rosie):** Ambition, reward, and the power of hard work.
4.  **The Iron Thread (The Injury):** Resilience in the face of a broken dream.
5.  **The Healing Thread (Nursing):** Her ultimate calling and the future.

## Artistic Style (Publish Worthy)
*   **Narrative Voice:** First-person reflective ("I learned...", "I wove...").
*   **Visual Language:** Watercolor with soft focus, bleeding edges, and hand-sketched details. 
*   **Symbolism:** A recurring motif of a golden thread appearing in the background of major illustrations.
